# linuxphone-tweaks

A few little things that I have accumulated over time:

* config/supertuxkart contains a file that enables you to use supertuxkart on a touchscreen
* desktop-files contains a variety of tweaked \*.desktop files to put in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
* etc/environment is my /etc/environment which contains a few settings for Qt/Plasma Mobile apps on non-Plasma-Mobile distributions and a few GTK4/GST tweaks

More to come!

These tweaks were previously hosted on https://framagit.org/linmobapps/linmobapps.frama.io.
