# linuxphone-tweaks

A few little things that I have accumulated over time:

* config/supertuxkart contains a file that enables you to use supertuxkart on a touchscreen
* desktop-files contains a variety of tweaked \*.desktop files to put in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
* etc/environment is my /etc/environment which contains a few settings for Qt/Plasma Mobile apps on non-Plasma-Mobile distributions and a few GTK4/GST tweaks

More to come!

For some content regarding Linux Phones, make sure to check out my blog [linmob.net](https://linmob.net/)!

I also maintain an [apps list](https://linmobapps.frama.io), share a [few Arch Linux PKGBUILD scripts](https://framagit.org/linmobapps/pkgbuilds), one [APKBUILD](https://framagit.org/linmobapps/apkbuilds) and a [flatpak manifest](https://framagit.org/1peter10/flatpaks) at other places.

These tweaks were previously hosted on https://framagit.org/linmobapps/linmobapps.frama.io.
