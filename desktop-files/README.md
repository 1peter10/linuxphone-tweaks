# .desktop files

This folder contains desktop files that should go into `~/.local/share/applications`, regardless of the sub-folder they are in:
'fixes' contains PinePhone specific fixes to launchers, usually affecting the Exec=-line only,
'ssb' contains launchers for the site-specific-browsers,
'hidden' contains .desktop files to hide unnecessary app launchers.
